### Log File Commands

Note:  only the Single Log and Daily Log channels are supported at this time

Clear the contents of the current log file while keeping the file itself in tact:

```php
php artisan log:clean
```

Delete all log files in the Log directory (will only remove files with the .log extension)

```php
php artisan log:purge
```

Create a new dedicated class called a Domain in a separate folder under App\Domains that can be reused throughout the application

```php
php artisan make:domain DomainName   #  Note - to put a domain in a sub folder, enter the folder name followed by domain name - i.e. folder\name
```
