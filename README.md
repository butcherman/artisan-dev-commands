### Log File Commands

Clear the contents of the current log file while keeping the file itself in tact:

```php
php artisan log:clean
```

Delete all log files in the Log directory (will only remove files with the .log extension)

```php
php artisan log:purge
```

Create a new Laravel Trait in the app/Traits folder

```php
php artisan make:trait TraitName    //  or  Folder/TraitName
```

Create a new Vue page located at /resources/js/Pages with a basic Vue template.  Adding a new Vue page in a sub folder uses the dot (.) syntax similar to the View syntax

```php
php artisan make:page Folder.pageName   //  To add the component using the Vue's Options API, add the --optionsApi flag
```

Create a new Vue component located at /resources/js/Components with a basic Vue template.  Adding a new Vue component in a sub folder uses the dot (.) syntax similar to the View syntax

```php
php artisan make:vuecomponent Folder.componentName      //  To add the component using the Vue's Options API, add the --optionsApi flag
```
